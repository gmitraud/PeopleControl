Hi. Welcome.

This is PeopleControl.
PeopleControl was made in order to acchieve completion of the OM30 Ruby on Rails Front-End Challenge.

It was used:
- Ruby, version 2.6.10p210 (2022-04-12 revision 67958)
- Rails, version 5.2.8.1
- rvm, version 1.29.12

Simply run ```rails s``` on your terminal to start and type on your browser localhost:3000 and it should be everything ready.

Features:

- The main video is coded to start as soon as you move your cursor into it. Hovering starts the video, hovering out pauses the video. Hover back in to resume.
  Player will always start on mute, however it can be unmuted if one prefers.

- On registering a new municipe or editing a current municipe, typing the CEP field should fill the fields "Rua", "Bairro", "Cidade", "UF", and "IBGE" automatically.

Thank you for your attention!
